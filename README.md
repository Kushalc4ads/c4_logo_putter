# c4_logo_putter
Add the C4ADS logo to all the images in a directory. 

Steps:

2. Depending on if you want to add the logo with the tagline or now, you will have to run the command:
`python add_logo.py logoless --tagline` if you want the tagline or
`python add_logo.py logoless` if you don't want it.
